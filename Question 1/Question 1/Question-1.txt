Create a function find_short_long_word(words_list). The function should return a tuple of the shortest word in the 
list and the longest word in the list (in that order). If there are multiple words that qualify as the shortest word,
return the first shortest word in the list. And if there are multiple words that qualify as the longest word, 
return the last longest word in the list.

For example, for the following list:


words = ['go', 'run', 'play', 'see', 'my', 'stay']

the function should return

('go', 'stay')

Assume the input list is non-empty.
